Exploring LLM Emotional Intelligence: An Unconventional Study and Comparative Analysis

This study attempts to evaluate the emotional intelligence of different LLMs from a human psychology perspective. I used a set of personality test questions developed by renowned investor Ray Dalio to test the responses of LLMs, and asked them to provide reasoning for each answer. I was surprised to find that for the same question, different LLMs tended to give answers with the same inclination, perhaps with subtle differences in degree but not greatly so! What surprised me most was that for each question, the reasoning they provided for their answers displayed remarkably upright values and extremely high emotional intelligence across the LLMs. This small study may help alleviate some of the growing fears about future LLM development!
